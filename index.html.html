    <main style="background-color: beige;"><p>Our dignity is created when we strive to maintain harmony with people. We dedicate ourselves diligently to the
        task of building a rapport with our community. We talk politely and listen patiently to others. As a result, our
        image gets created in peopleâ€™s good books.

        We leave a positive impression on the society in which we live. This positive outcome is earned by maintaining a
        good rapport with others.

        However, our efforts are not limited to only our community but to people belonging from all spheres of life.
        These motives are derived in us by the upbringing that we have been inherited during our childhood. The
        upbringing in a proper way shapes our behavior. Our behavior is comprised of human values, good and bad manners,
        and flaws. These aspects of behavior influence us to achieve our aims.

        We are basically known by the human values and manners that we represent in front of the public. A well-mannered
        individual is asked and respected by all. He is equipped with the principles that are followed by him
        religiously. His principles are the guidelines of how to interact politely and patiently with his acquaintances
        and the rules to achieve success in the future.

        Ethical conduct is the key to success. It is the habit of paying attention to things that we encounter and
        responding in sound manners. Thus, courteousness our taught by our guardians in every moment of life. We are
        taught to smile whenever is required because smiling produces positive energy around us. This is the sign of
        integrity that we are blessed with. Respect acknowledges the integrity we show towards others. The connection is
        exhibited by holding doors for others, abiding our eldersâ€™ advice, and greeting the young and adults generously.
        Sharing is the effort to create friendship and simultaneously leads to a peaceful decorum in a room.</p>
